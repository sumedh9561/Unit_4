
Q1) Explain about the Marker interface?

An interface that does not contain methods, fields, and constants is known as marker interface.
In other words, an empty interface is known as marker interface or tag interface. It delivers the
run-time type information about an object. It is the reason that the JVM and compiler have additional
information about an object. The Serializable and Cloneable interfaces are the example of marker
interface.In short,it indicates a signal or command to the JVM.


The declaration of marker interface is the same as interface in Java but the interface must be empty.
For example:

public interface Serializable
{

}
