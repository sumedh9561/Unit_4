 Ans :-
        JSE :- java standard edition, JSE. It allows the development
               and deployment of java applications used in desktops, servers,
               embedded environments and real-time environments. java SE contains
               classes developed for java web services and provides a foundation
               for java platform and enterprise edition (JEE).

       JEE :-java enterprise edition, JEE. Enterprise Edition helps develop and
               deploy portable, robust, scalable and secure server-side java applications.
               Java EE is built on the basis of java SE. It provides Web services, component
               models, management and communication APIs, which can be used To achieve enterprise-level
               service-oriented architecture (service oriented architecture, SOA) and Web 2.0 applications.

       JME :- java mirco edition, JME. Provide a robust and flexible environment for
              applications running on mobile devices and embedded devices (such as
              mobile phones, PDAs, TV set-top boxes, and printers). Java ME includes
              a flexible user interface, a robust security model, many built-in network
              protocols, and rich support for networked and offline applications that can
              be downloaded dynamically. Applications based on the Java ME specification
              only need to be written once and can be used for many devices, and can take
              advantage of the native functions of each device.
