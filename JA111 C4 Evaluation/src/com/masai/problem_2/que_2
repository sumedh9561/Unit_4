
Q2.Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.

Ans:-
      The hashcode() and equals() are two important methods provided by the object class in the parent class
      for comparing objects. the object class is the parent class for all java objeccts.

      Equals()

      The java equals() is a method of lang.object class and it is used to campare two object.
      to compare two object that wheather they are the same,ir compares the values of both the
      object attributes.
      by default two objects will be the same only if stored in the same memmory location
      generate contrat of equale(),methods
      * reflexive
      * symmentric
      * transitive
      * consistent

       Syntax:
      public boolean equals(Object obj)

      hashcode()

     A hash mode is an integer value associated with every object in java, facilititing the hashing in hash table.
     to get this hashcode valie for an object,we can used the hashcode ethod in java means hashcode method that return ther
     integer hashcode vcalue of the given object
     The hashomode method return the same hash value when called on the two object  which are according to the equals method
     and if the object are unequal it usually return diffrent hash values.

     syntax
    public int hashcode()
