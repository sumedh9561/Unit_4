Ans:-
      Java is a platform independent because it uses a virtual machine .
      The jav programming language and all APIs are complicated into bytecodes.
      Bytes are effectively platform independent. The virtual machine take care of
      the different platforms. The run time requirements for java are therefore very small.
      The java virtual machine take care of all hardware related issues so that code has be
      complied for different hardware.
